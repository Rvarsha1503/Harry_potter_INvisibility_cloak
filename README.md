# Harry_potter_INvisibility_cloak
This project brings the magic of Harry Potter's invisibility cloak to life using computer vision techniques with OpenCV. By using a blue cloth as the cloak, the program captures the background and then replaces the blue areas of the frame with the captured background, making the person wearing the cloak appear invisible.
